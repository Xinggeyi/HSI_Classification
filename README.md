# HSI_Classification

Hyperspectral Imagery Classification

Here, I show some traditional algorithms and deep learning methods for hyperspectral imagery classification.

For detail, please read every readme file in the specificed methods.
In this readme, I give a list for these methods.

-------------------------------
## Traditional machine learning based methods
- KNN(K近邻)
- SVM(支撑向量机)

-------------------------------
## Deep learning based methods
- 1D-CNN (一维卷积神经网络)
- 2D-CNN (二维卷积神经网络)
- 3D-CNN (三维卷积神经网络)
